# docker-rclone

Docker image for [rclone](https://rclone.org/) mount with

- Ubuntu 22.04
- pooling filesystem (a choice of mergerfs or unionfs)
- some useful scripts

## Usage

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  rclone:
    container_name: rclone
    image: wiserain/rclone                      # or ghcr.io/wiserain/rclone
    restart: always
    network_mode: "bridge"
    volumes:
      - ${DOCKER_ROOT}/rclone/config:/config
      - ${DOCKER_ROOT}/rclone/log:/log
      - ${DOCKER_ROOT}/rclone/cache:/cache
      - /your/mounting/point:/data:shared
      - /local/dir/to/be/merged/with:/local     # Optional: if you have a folder to be mergerfs/unionfs with
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - apparmor:unconfined
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
      - TZ=Asia/Seoul
      - RCLONE_REMOTE_PATH=remote_name:path/to/mount
```

equivalently,

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name=rclone \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
    --device /dev/fuse \
    --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
    -v ${DOCKER_ROOT}/rclone/config:/config \
    -v ${DOCKER_ROOT}/rclone/log:/log \
    -v ${DOCKER_ROOT}/rclone/cache:/cache \
    -v /your/mounting/point:/data:shared \
    -v /local/dir/to/be/merged/with:/local \
    -e PUID=${PUID} \
    -e PGID=${PGID} \
    -e TZ=Asia/Seoul \
    -e RCLONE_REMOTE_PATH=remote_name:path/to/mount \
    wiserain/rclone
```

First, you need to prepare an rclone configuration file in `/config/rclone.conf`. It can be done manually (copy yourself) or by running a built-in script below

```bash
docker-compose exec <service_name> rclone_setup
```

Then, up and run your container with a proper environment variable `RCLONE_REMOTE_PATH` which specifies an rclone remote path you want to mount. In the initialization process of every container start, it will check 1) existance of `rclone.conf` and 2) validation of `RCLONE_REMOTE_PATH` whether it actually exists in `rclone.conf`. If there is any problem, please check container log by

```bash
docker logs <container name or sha1, e.g. rclone>
```

### rclone mount

Here is the internal command for rclone mount.

```bash
rclone mount ${RCLONE_REMOTE_PATH} ${rclone_mountpoint} \
    --uid=${PUID:-911} \
    --gid=${PGID:-911} \
    --cache-dir=/cache \
    --use-mmap \
    --allow-other \
    --umask=002 \
    --rc \
    --rc-no-auth \
    --rc-addr=:5574 \
    ${RCLONE_MOUNT_USER_OPTS}
```

Please note that variables only with capital letters are configurable by environment variables. Also, be aware that rc is enabled by default.

| ENV  | Description  | Default  |
|---|---|---|
| `PUID` / `PGID`  | uid and gid for running an app  | `911` / `911`  |
| `TZ`  | timezone, required for correct timestamp in log  |   |
| `RCLONE_REMOTE_PATH`  | this should be in `rclone.conf`  |   |
| `RCLONE_CONFIG`  | path to `rclone.conf`  |  `/config/rclone.conf` |
| `RCLONE_LOG_LEVEL`  | log level for rclone runtime  | `NOTICE`  |
| `RCLONE_LOG_FILE`  | to redirect logging to file  |   |
| `RCLONE_MOUNT_USER_OPTS`  | additioanl arguments will be appended to the basic options in the above command  |   |

## [mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) or unionfs (optional)

Along with the rclone folder, you can specify one local directory to be mergerfs with by `POOLING_FS=mergerfs`. Internally, it will execute a following command

```bash
mergerfs \
    -o uid=${PUID:-911},gid=${PGID:-911},umask=022,allow_other \
    -o ${MFS_USER_OPTS} \
    /local=RW:/cloud=NC /data
```

where a default value of `MFS_USER_OPTS` is

```bash
MFS_USER_OPTS="rw,use_ino,func.getattr=newest,category.action=all,category.create=ff,cache.files=auto-full,dropcacheonclose=true"
```

If you want unionfs instead of mergerfs, set `POOLING_FS=unionfs`, which will apply

```bash
unionfs \
    -o uid=${PUID:-911},gid=${PGID:-911},umask=022,allow_other \
    -o ${UFS_USER_OPTS} \
    /local=RW:/cloud=RO /data
```

where a default value of `UFS_USER_OPTS` is

```bash
UFS_USER_OPTS="cow,direct_io,nonempty,auto_cache,sync_read"
```

### Built-in scripts

Two scripts performing basic rclone operations such as copy and move between `/local` and `/cloud` are prepared for your conveinence. Since they are from local to cloud directories, it is meaningful only when you mount an additional `/local` directory.

#### copy_local

You can make a copy of files in `/local` to `/cloud` by

```bash
docker exec -it <container name or sha1, e.g. rclone> copy_local
```

If you want to exclude a certain folder from copy, just put an empty `.nocopy` file on the folder root. Then, the script will ignore the sub-tree from the operation.

#### move_local

In contrast to `copy_local`, `move_local` consists of three consecutive sub-operations. First, it will move old files. If `MOVE_LOCAL_AFTER_DAYS` is set, files older than that days will be moved. Then, it will move files exceed size of `MOVE_LOCAL_EXCEEDS_GB` by the amount of `MOVE_LOCAL_FREEUP_GB`. Finally, it will move the rest of files in `/local` only if `MOVE_LOCAL_ALL=true`. As a cleanup, it will remove empty directories in `/local` unless `KEEP_EMPTY_DIRS=1` is set.

The command and the way to exclude subfolders are almost the same as for `copy_local`, but `.nomove` file in this case.

#### cron - disabled by default

After making sure that a single execution of scripts is okay, you can add cron jobs of these operations by setting environment variables.

| ENV  | Description  | Default  |
|---|---|---|
| `COPY_LOCAL_CRON`  | cron schedule for copy_local  |  |
| `MOVE_LOCAL_CRON`  | cron schedule for move_local  |  |
